# Change point regression models

In this lab we will investigate another class of models which are extremely flexible in their application. 

This topic can be seen as piecewise regression.

You can answer the questions and carry out the lab by filling in this RMD document.

# Stagnant Water: Change point model

$y_i$ is the log flow rate down an inclined channel, and $x_i$ is the  log height of stagnant surface layers of different surfactants. The rate of decline in flow rate seems to suddenly increase around $x=0$.

# The change point model

$$y_i \sim N(\mu_i, \sigma^2)$$
$$\mu_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i +  \beta_2(x_i -\theta)I_{(1, x_i\ge\theta,\; 0\; else)}$$

# The data

```{r data}
dataList = list(y = c(1.12, 1.12, 0.99, 1.03, 0.92, 0.90, 0.81, 0.83, 0.65, 0.67, 0.60,  0.59, 0.51, 0.44, 0.43, 0.43, 0.33, 0.30, 0.25, 0.24, 0.13, -0.01, -0.13,  -0.14, -0.30, -0.33, -0.46,  -0.43, -0.65),
     x = c(-1.39, -1.39, -1.08, -1.08, -0.94, -0.80, -0.63, -0.63, -0.25, -0.25, -0.12, -0.12, 0.01, 0.11, 0.11, 0.11,  0.25, 0.25, 0.34, 0.34, 0.44, 0.59, 0.70, 0.70, 0.85, 0.85,  0.99, 0.99, 1.19),
     N = 29)

```

# Task 1

## Plot the data using ggplot

```{r plotdata}

df = data.frame(x = dataList$x, y=dataList$y)

head(df)

library(ggplot2)
# place code here
g=ggplot(df,aes(x=x,y=y))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "loess",se=TRUE)+ggtitle("Jishan's plot")
g

```

## Comment on the plot
>
When `x` increases, there is a change in the plot--happened near `x=-0.25`.Before and after the change section, the line is a straight line (linear), and within the change, we can see a curve in this area. We should find the place the change happens.

# Task 2

## Inspect the jags model below and answer the questions

```{r model, eval=FALSE}
model 
{
  for (i in 1:N) {
    y[i]    ~ dnorm(mu[i], tau)
    mu[i]  <- beta0 + beta[1]*x[i] + beta[2]*(x[i] - theta)* step(x[i] - theta)
  }
  tau       ~ dgamma(0.001, 0.001) #low impact prior 
  beta0     ~ dnorm(0.0, 1.0E-6)
  for (j in 1:2) {
    beta[j] ~ dnorm(0.0, 1.0E-6)
  }
  sigma    <- 1/sqrt(tau)
  theta     ~ dunif(-1.3, 1.1) #prior on theta
}
```

### In the expression of the analytical model we used $I_{(1, x_i\ge\theta,\; 0\; else)}$

What jags function is used for $I$?
> 
`step()` is used for `I`.

### A prior is placed on $\tau$ 

What is the mean and variance of the prior distribution for $\tau$?
```{r}
# shape and rate
curve(dgamma(x,shape = 0.001,rate=0.001),xlim = c(0,10))
tau=dgamma(0.001, 0.001)
mean_tau=0.001/0.001
mean_tau
var_tau=0.001/0.001^2
var_tau
```


# Task 3

## Make a Jags script

Make a complete Jags script to run the model. You can use the script below and alter it to fit.

```{r jagscript}
library(rjags)
#Define the model:
modelString = "
model{
for(i in 1:N)
{
  y[i]    ~ dnorm(mu[i], tau)
  mu[i]  <- beta0 + beta[1]*x[i] + beta[2]*(x[i] - theta)* step(x[i] - theta)
}
  tau       ~ dgamma(0.001, 0.001) #low impact prior 
  beta0     ~ dnorm(0.0, 1.0E-6)
  for (j in 1:2) 
  {
    beta[j] ~ dnorm(0.0, 1.0E-6)
  }
  sigma    <- 1/sqrt(tau)
  theta     ~ dunif(-1.3, 1.1) #prior on theta

  int2 = beta0 - beta[1]*theta
  slope2=beta[1]+beta[2]


}

" # close quote for modelString
writeLines( modelString , con="TEMPmodel.txt" )

#  initsList = list( theta=thetaInit )

initsList = list(tau=1,beta0=2,beta=c(1,2),theta=1)
# Run the chains:
jagsModel = jags.model( file="TEMPmodel.txt" , data=dataList , inits=initsList , 
                        n.chains=3 , n.adapt=500 )
list.samplers(jagsModel)

update( jagsModel , n.iter=500 )
codaSamples = coda.samples( jagsModel , variable.names=c("beta0", "beta","tau","sigma","theta","int2","slope2"),
                            n.iter=33340 )
save( codaSamples , file=paste0("lab10","Mcmc.Rdata") )

summary(codaSamples)

library(ggmcmc)
s = ggs(codaSamples)
ggs_density(s)

ggs_crosscorrelation(s)

```
